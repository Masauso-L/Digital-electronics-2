## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)


   * Common Cathode 7-segment display (CC SSD): Have all of their segments' cathodes connected to a common ground, the respective anodes connected to individual pins i.e.  Active high
   
   * Common Anode 7-segment display (CA SSD): Have all of their segments' anodes connected to a common source, the respective cathodes connected to individual pins i.e.  Active low

Binary values of the segments for display 0 to 9 on a common anode 7-segment display.
